        Data protection is a matter of trust, and your privacy is important to us. We shall therefore only use your name and other information that relates to you in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. We will only collect information where it is necessary for us to do so and will only collect information if it is relevant to our dealings with you.

        We will only keep your information for as long as we are either required to by law or as is relevant for the purposes for which it was collected.

        You can visit the Site and browse without having to provide personal details. During your visit to the Site, you remain anonymous, and at no time can we identify you unless you have an account on the Site and log on with your user name and password.

        Data Collection:

        We may collect various information if you seek to place an order for a product on the Site.

        We collect, store, and process your data for processing your purchase on the Site and any possible later claims, and to provide you with our services. We may collect your title, name, gender, email address, postal address, delivery address (if different), telephone number, mobile number, fax number, payment details, payment card details, or bank account details.

        We need this information to allow you to proceed with placing your order for a product. We may use that data to process payment for the product and deliver the product to you. We also use that data to inform you when the product is about to be delivered.

        We may pass your name and address on to a third party to make delivery of the product to you (for example to our courier or supplier).

        We may also use your data to manage the Site, collect payment from you, enable you to use parts of the Site, detect fraud or Site abuses, send you information relevant to the Site or our products, and address any queries.

        You must only submit to us or our agent or the Site information that is accurate and not misleading, and you must keep it up to date and inform us of changes.

        Your actual order details may be stored with us, and you may access this information by logging into your account on the Site. Here you can view the details of your orders that have been completed, those which are open, and those which are shortly to be dispatched, and administer your address details, bank details, and any newsletter to which you may have subscribed. You undertake to treat the personal access data confidentially and not make it available to unauthorized third parties. We cannot assume any liability for misuse of passwords unless this misuse is our fault.

        We shall not share any of your personal information with third parties without your explicit consent. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent, and we only use your information as described in the Privacy Policy. We view the protection of your privacy as a very important community principle. We understand clearly that you and Your Information are one of our most important assets. We store and process Your Information on computers located in India that are protected by physical as well as technological security devices. We use third parties to verify and certify our privacy principles. If you object to your Information being transferred or used in this way, please do not use the site.

        Under no circumstances do we rent, trade, or share your personal information that we have collected with any other company for their marketing purposes without your consent. We reserve the right to communicate your personal information to any third party that makes a legally-compliant request for its disclosure.

        Credit Check and Fraud Prevention:

        We use standard and authorized payment services, and our Credit Check and Fraud Prevention policies are aligned with these companies. All disputes would be handled by Mumbai courts.

        Other Uses of Your Personal Information:

        We may also send you other information about us, the Site, our other websites, our products, sales promotions, our newsletters, SMS updates, anything relating to other companies in our group, or our business partners. If you would prefer not to receive any of this additional information as detailed in this paragraph (or any part of it), please click the “unsubscribe” link in any email that we send to you or follow the unsubscription process as detailed in the SMS. Kindly note that unsubscribing from one medium does not automatically lead to unsubscription from the other. Within 7 working days (days which are neither (i) a Saturday or Sunday, nor (ii) a public holiday anywhere in India) of receipt of your instruction, we will cease to send you information as requested. If your instruction is unclear, we will contact you for clarification.

        Cookies:

        The acceptance of cookies is not a requirement for visiting the Site. However, we would like to point out that some functionality on the Site and ordering is only possible with the activation of cookies. Cookies are tiny text files that identify your computer to our server as a unique user when you visit certain pages on the Site, and they are stored by your Internet browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies can be used to recognize your Internet Protocol address, saving you time while you are on, or want to enter, the Site. We only use cookies for your convenience in using the Site (for example, to remember who you are when you want to amend your shopping cart without having to re-enter your email address) and not for obtaining or using any other information about you (for example, targeted advertising). Your browser can be set to not accept cookies, but this would restrict your use of the Site. Please accept our assurance that our use of cookies does not contain any personal or private details and is free from viruses.

        The Site uses technology from Google Analytics through which data is collected and stored for marketing and optimization purposes and data use profiles are prepared under a pseudonym. Cookies may be used for this. The cookies enable recognition of the Internet browser. The data collected with these technologies is not used, without separate authorization by the person concerned, to personally identify the visitors to this website and is not collated with personal data on the pseudonym holder. The permission for data recording and storage may at any time be cancelled with on-going effect.

        Security:

        We have in place appropriate technical and security measures to prevent unauthorized or unlawful access to or accidental loss of or destruction or damage to your information. When we collect data through the Site, we collect your personal details on a secure server. We use firewalls on our servers. When we collect payment card details electronically, we use encryption by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) coding. Whilst we are unable to guarantee 100% security, this makes it hard for a hacker to decrypt your details. You are strongly recommended not to send full credit or debit card details in unencrypted electronic communications with us. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of your information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. You are responsible for protecting against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.

        Consent:

        By submitting data to us or our agent or using the Site, you consent to our use of your data in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.

        Copyright:

        We have copyright over this Privacy Policy. Use by third parties, even by way of extract, for commercial purposes is not allowed. Infringements may be subject to legal action.

        This Privacy Policy can change at any time to include / exclude clauses, and we do not bear responsibility for updating Users on the same.
